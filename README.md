# cloth-semantic-segmentation


## Overview
This project focuses on semantic segmentation of clothing items in images using deep learning techniques. Semantic segmentation is the task of classifying each pixel in an image into a specific category, such as shirt, pants, or shoes. The goal is to accurately segment clothing items to enable various applications in fashion, virtual try-on, and image editing.

Virtual Outfit Changer Plugin with FiftyOne
Introduction
Welcome to the Virtual Outfit Changer Plugin section, where we will explore the creation of an innovative tool that revolutionizes image segmentation. By building a virtual outfit changer plugin using the FiftyOne app, we delve into the realms of semantic segmentation and inpainting, enabling users to transform clothing items in images with a simple prompt.

Problem Statement
In the world of fashion and image editing, the ability to seamlessly modify clothing items in images presents a significant challenge. Traditional methods often require complex manual editing or lack the ability to accurately segment clothing items for modification.

Solution Overview
To address this challenge, we propose the development of a virtual outfit changer plugin. This tool will leverage advanced techniques in semantic segmentation and inpainting to generate modified images based on user prompts. By training a custom segmentation model and integrating it with an inpainting model, we can achieve precise and realistic modifications to clothing items in images.

Idea Implementation
Data Preparation: We start by collecting and preparing a dataset of images with annotated clothing items. This dataset will serve as the foundation for training our custom segmentation model.
Model Creation: We dive into the creation of our segmentation model, leveraging state-of-the-art techniques such as Segformer. This model will be trained to accurately identify and segment clothing items in images.
Training: With our dataset and model architecture in place, we embark on the training process. Through iterations and optimizations, we aim to achieve high accuracy and robust performance in clothing item segmentation.
Inpainting Integration: Following model training, we integrate our segmentation model with an inpainting model. This integration allows us to generate modified images based on user prompts and segmentation masks.
Plugin Development: We extend the functionality of our tool by developing a simple and intuitive plugin for the FiftyOne app. This plugin enables users to select samples, apply prompts, and generate modified images with ease.
Usage and Evaluation: Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of our virtual outfit changer plugin by showcasing sample results and evaluating its performance. We highlight its potential applications in visual outfit changing and data augmentation.
Conclusion
Through the development of our virtual outfit changer plugin, we aim to revolutionize the way clothing items are modified in images. By combining advanced techniques in semantic segmentation and inpainting with the user-friendly interface of the FiftyOne app, we empower users to unleash their creativity and transform images with just a few clicks.

Let's embark on this exciting journey as we dive into data preparation and lay the groundwork for our innovative tool.
